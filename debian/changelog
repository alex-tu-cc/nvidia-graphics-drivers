nvidia-graphics-drivers-375 (375.66-0ubuntu0.16.04.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - CVE-2017-0350, 2017-0351, 2017-0353 (LP: #1689336).
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
      o Quadro P3000
      o Quadro M520
      o TITAN Xp
    - Fixed a bug that could cause EGL applications to crash when
      calling eglInitialize() multiple times on X11-backed displays.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause rendering corruption on a
      monitor connected via DisplayPort upon a modeset event (for
      example, changing resolutions or power cycling the monitor).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to crash when
      VT switching between multiple X servers.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the system to become unresponsive after
      resuming from power management suspend/hibernate.Â  Additional
      symptoms of this bug included display flickering and "Xid 56"
      errors in the kernel log.
    - Fixed a bug that caused backlight brightness to not be
      controllable on some notebooks with DisplayPort internal
      panels.
    - Fixed a bug that left HDMI and DisplayPort audio muted after a
      framebuffer console mode was restored. For some displays, this
      caused the display to remain blank.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over DisplayPort to stop working
      when the monitor was unplugged and plugged back in or awoken
      from DPMS power-saving mode.
    - Restored support for the following GPU:
      GRID K520
    - Fixed a regression that caused corruption in certain
      applications, such as window border shadows in Unity, after
      resuming from suspend.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some applications to crash when
      running with PRIME Sync.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME Sync from working on notebooks
      with GeForce GTX 4xx and 5xx series GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL apps to have excessive CPU usage
      when running with PRIME Sync but without native displays
      enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause PRIME Sync to deadlock in the
      kernel, particularly common on Linux 4.10.
    - Fixed a bug that caused PRIME Sync to run slowly on systems
      with Pascal GPUs.
